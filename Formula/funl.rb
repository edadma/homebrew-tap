# Homebrew formula for FunL: one backtracking VM running FunL, regular expressions and ISO Prolog.
#
# The formula installs the prebuilt macOS binaries rather than building from source, because
# building needs the sysl compiler. The tarball holds both executables, `funl` and `prolog`; each
# links only against libraries macOS ships (libSystem, libcurl, libsqlite3, libobjc), except that
# `funl` also links Homebrew's libuv for `funl:async` and SDL3 for `funl:graphics`' windows, hence
# the two dependencies.
