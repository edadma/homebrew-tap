# Homebrew formula for the texish command-line tool.
#
# This is a template: `tools/brew-formula.sh <version>` fills in the version and the four SHA256
# fields from the assets the "Release binaries" workflow attaches, and the release workflow runs it
# and pushes the result to Formula/texish.rb in the edadma/homebrew-tap repository. See README.md in
# this directory.
#
# The formula installs a prebuilt binary rather than building from source, because building means
# a JDK, sbt, Scala Native's LLVM toolchain and a full compile — a lot to ask of a package that
# ships as one static-ish executable. Cairo, FreeType and libjpeg-turbo remain runtime dependencies
# because the binary links against them.
